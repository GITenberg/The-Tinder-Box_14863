description: All love is a gas, and it takes either loneliness, strength of character,
  or religion to liquefy it into a condition to be ladled out of us, one to another.
  There is a certain dangerously volatile state of it; and occasionally people, especially
  of opposite sexes, try to administer it to each other in that form, with asphyxiation
  resulting to both hearts. And I'm willing to confess that it is generally a woman's
  fault when such an accident occurs. That is, it is a mistake of her nature, not
  one of intent. But she is learning! Also when a woman is created, the winds have
  wooed star-dust, rose-dew, peach-down, and a few flint-shavings into a whirlwind
  of deviltry, and the world at large looks on in wonder and sore amazement, as well
  as breathless interest. I know, because I am one, and have just been waked up by
  the gyrations of the cyclone; and I'm deeply confounded. I don't like it, and wish
  I could have slept longer, but Fate and Jane Mathers decreed otherwise. At least
  Jane decreed, and Fate seems so far helpless to controvert the decree.
